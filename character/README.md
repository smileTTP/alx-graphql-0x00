# Character Query - Rick and Morty API

The project uses the popular [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql) as its data source. 

## Objectives 

- Construct precise GraphQL queries to request specific data.
- Understand and use arguments (like id and page) to filter and paginate results.
- Structure queries to include only the necessary fields, avoiding over-fetching of data.
- Differentiate between querying for a single item and a paginated list of items.
